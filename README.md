##  Problem statement

To distill information that would be of utility and benefit to those individuals and organizations that have as their intent the desire and willingness to improve life in the City of Chicago.

## Executive Summary

To gather and use data to make informed decisions, guide behavior, and improve outcomes  --  whether for an individual or an institution -- is the raison d'etre for data science.  The historical images of Al Capone to the current rendering of "Chi-raq" makes for a highly charged atmosphere, with openings to inflame emotions or distort realities.  The use of reason, science, and an exploratory spirit to dive into volumes of raw crime data to hopefully (but without guarantees) extract meaningful insights was the motivating driver.
